# dice-simulator
A dice simulator in Python generates random numbers between 1 to 6, simulating the roll of a standard six-sided die. It uses the random module to generate pseudo-random numbers, and the randint() function to simulate dice rolls. It can be used for games, simulations, and other applications requiring random number generation.
